This is a placeholder for the OCR A Std font file.

To complete the setup:
1. Download the actual OCR A Std font file from a legitimate source like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts
2. Replace this placeholder file with the actual OCRA.ttf font file
3. The font registration is already added to MauiProgram.cs

Font sources:
- Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/ (search for "OCR")
- Adobe Fonts: https://fonts.adobe.com/
- Or use a similar monospace font that resembles credit card embossed text

Make sure you have proper licensing for any font you use in your application.
